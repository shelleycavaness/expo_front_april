## The Concept ("How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference")
How to create an app to help everyday people take small actions in the hope that small things add up to bigger things. We wanted to motivate and teach individuals how to change their habits, and we based our model on positive reinforcement. We imagined that each positive action would give  points to each individual player. We also thought that groups stimulate and would help keep up the momentum - so we also wanted individuals to be able create or join goups. The first step of the project will be for solo players.
