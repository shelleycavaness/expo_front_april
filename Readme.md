# Mon Eco-defi  :frog:
## The Concept ("How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference")
How to create an app to help everyday people take small actions in the hope that small things add up to bigger things. We wanted to motivate and teach individuals how to change their habits, and we based our model on positive reinforcement. We imagined that each positive action would give  points to each individual player. We also thought that groups stimulate and would help keep up the momentum - so we also wanted individuals to be able create or join goups. The first step of the project will be for solo players.

## The Game
The game is called Mon Eco-defi, every day a player receive an environmental challenge, the player can accept or refuse it. When a player accepts the challenge he or she earns points, and playing the game makes people change their habits. And what makes playing more fun? Playing with and against other people. So players join teams and teams compete against one another. Teamwork not only increases the richness of relationships, but competition motivates people to continue playing. Individual and collective participation help people change thinking and habits. And as a result we lower our carbon footprint.
